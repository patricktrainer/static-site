<p>Materialize easily processes complex analytics over streaming datasets – offering the power and flexibility of a SQL data warehouse for the world of real-time data.</p>

<p>Materialize is the only technology that can enable engineers to completely develop for streaming data in a powerful declarative language – PostgreSQL – instead of building microservices.</p>
<p>Materialize empowers anyone within a company to discover insights from real-time data, identify problems immediately, and take action in critical moments.</p>
<p>Materialize connects directly to event stream processors (like Kafka) and incrementally updates computations within milliseconds.</p>
<p>Other systems place the burden on you to make their systems work. Materialize can manage your data as it exists - without any preprocessing required.</p>
<p>No "inspired by SQL" half-broken query languages. Materialize supports PostgreSQL. Use the Postgres CLI or your favorite database adapter.</p>

<p>Materialize is the first and only streaming system capable of running the TPC-H decision support benchmark – a set of criteria originally developed for the world of batch data warehouses.</p>
<p>This standard includes support for complex joins – including complicated multiple-way joins across disparate data sources – previously unavailable in the world of streaming.</p>

<p>A common approach towards building streaming data architecture is to develop a series of custom microservices – which are often time-intensive, complicated, and ultimately brittle.</p>
<p>With Materialize, data engineering teams can move away from the endless development of microservices – and replace thousands of lines of Java with a few lines of SQL.</p>
