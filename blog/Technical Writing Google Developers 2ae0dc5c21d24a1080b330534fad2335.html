<p>We've aimed these courses at people in the following roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>professional software engineers</li>
<li>computer science students</li>
<li>engineering-adjacent roles, such as product managers</li>
</ul>
<p>You need at least a little writing proficiency in English, but you don't need to be a strong writer to take these courses.</p>
<p>You will find these courses easier to understand if you have at least a little background in coding, though you don't need to be an expert coder.</p>
<p>These courses focus on technical writing, not on general English writing or business writing.</p>
