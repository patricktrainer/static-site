<p>Technical Writing One teaches you how to write clearer technical documentation.</p>
<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>You need at least a little writing proficiency in English, but you don't need to be a strong writer to take this course.</p>
<p>If you've never taken any technical writing training, this course is perfect for you. If you've taken technical writing training, this class provides an efficient refresher.</p>
<h2>Learning objectives</h2>
<p>This course teaches you the fundamentals of technical writing. After completing this class, you will know how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use terminology—including abbreviations and acronyms—consistently.</li>
<li>Recognize and disambiguate pesky pronouns.</li>
