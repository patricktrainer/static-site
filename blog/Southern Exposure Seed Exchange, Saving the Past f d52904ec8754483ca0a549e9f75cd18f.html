<p>Dear Valued Customers,</p>
<p><strong>We are currently not accepting new orders!</strong> Due to unprecedented demand for seeds, we have been inundated with orders and have had to stop accepting new ones once we reach our capacity for the day. We will attempt to be open every day starting around 11 AM, and we will announce our closing at least an hour in advance so as to not catch anyone off guard. We apologize for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience in these strange and difficult times!</p>
<p>Please note that we are not currently able to keep up with the call volume on our phones. If you have a pressing matter, e-mail is a better way to reach us: <a href="mailto:gardens@southernexposure.com">gardens@southernexposure.com</a></p>
<p>If you’re going out for supplies, you may find our seeds in a local <a href="https://southernexposure.com/retail-stores/">retail store</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please check out our <a href="https://www.southernexposure.com/growing-guides">seed saving guides</a> and <a href="https://www.southernexposure.com/growing-guides">our other growing guides</a></strong>. Saving your own seeds is an important part of self-sufficiency and our robust seed network. Almost all of our seeds are open-pollinated (not hybrid), so they can be saved from year-to-year. Please take advantage of this by saving your own seed and sharing with your neighbors.</p>
