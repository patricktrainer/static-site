<h2><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html">¶</a>quantified-self</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">"Quantified self"</a> refers to self tracking and coming up with metrics in order to gain more insight and potentially improve various aspects of your life such as health (physical or mental) or performance.</p>
<p>I personally haven't managed to gain any significant insights from the data I've collected so far. I don't really regret it though.</p>
<p>Body maintenance like sleep, diet or exercise are hard for most people and also boring for many, myself included. It sucks and given the opportunity, I'd get myself independent of physical shell in a blink. However, while I'm in it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I find that <strong>process of quantifying is fun</strong>, and even motivating for the routine!</p>
<p>E.g. I can't imagine going on a run without my HR monitor, because whatever the benefit exercise has and however exhausting run would be, at least I'll have a data point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning about routine and trying to optimize routine is also way <strong>more fun than doing the actual routine</strong></p>
<p>Human body is fragile and needs constant care, but it's still a fascinating mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>immunity to broscience</strong> and cargo cult</p>
<p>After trying to find interesting/significant correlations in my data and failing, I've started taking most of anecdotal advice from the internet about dieting/exercise and sleep with a pile of salt and mostly ignoring it.</p>
<p>If I can't feel changes subjectively and I can't find them using linear regression, then surely it just doesn't matter to my body.</p>
<p>I want to empathize though that it's specific to my body. I'm lucky to be healthy enough so I don't have anything obvious to 'fix'. I do know people who claim minor things changed the way they e.g. sleep, so <strong>I don't want to devalue others' experiences</strong>.</p>
<p>But if you do stress over so many (often contradictory) advises like I used to, I'd recommend trying to set up proper experiments and measure. Numbers don't lie, or at least harder to trick.</p>

<h2><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html">¶</a>lifelogging</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelog">Lifelogging</a> is not a new concept as people have kept diaries for centuries. However these days it's particularly easy to do because lots of it can be automated and collected passively from your digital trace.</p>
<p>Personally I do it because I find it fun, having access to your activities from the past is very satisfying and compensates for decaying memory and it fits well along the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html">#quantified-self</a> lines.</p>
