<p>Over the past nine months I’ve worked with over a dozen venture-funded startups to build out their internal analytics. In doing so, there’s a single SQL function that I have come to use surprisingly often. At first it wasn’t at all clear to me why I would want to use this function, but as time goes on I have found ever more uses for it.</p>
<p>What is it? <strong>md5()</strong>. If you’re not familiar, here’s an example snippet from the Redshift docs:</p>
<p>```
select md5('Amazon Redshift');</p>
<h2>md5</h2>
<p>f7415e33f972c03abd4f3fed36748f7a
(1 row)
```</p>
<p>Give md5() a varchar and it returns its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5 hash</a>. Simple…but seemingly pointless. <em>Why exactly would I want to use that?!</em></p>
<p>Great question. In this post I’m going to show you two uses for md5() that make it one of the most powerful tools in my SQL kit.</p>
<h2>#1: Building Yourself a Unique ID</h2>
<p>I’m going to make a really strong statement here, but it’s one that I really believe in: <strong>every single <a href="http://dbt.readthedocs.io/en/docs-0.6.0/guide/building-models/">data model</a> in your warehouse should have a rock solid unique ID</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s extremely common for this not to be the case. One reason is that your source data doesn’t have a unique key—if you’re syncing advertising performance data from Facebook Ads via <a href="http://stitchdata.com/">Stitch</a> or <a href="http://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a>, the source data in your ad_insights table doesn’t have a unique key you can rely on. Instead, you have a combination of fields that is reliably unique (in this case date and ad_id). Using that knowledge, you can build yourself a unique id using md5():</p>
<p>```
select 
    md5(date_start::varchar || ad_id::varchar) as insight_id
from 
    stitch_fb_ads.facebook_ads_insights
limit 5;</p>
<h2>insight_id</h2>
<p>6d475ea96f23b097b51ed500116d8c5e     822c9429eabb28ccbcd7286836d7cd60     8b7fcd2aff879772ccac4f0f8bcb6a45     8a2cfd7eb1a723c49db47232e73ca29c     10338719dfadb3d4c9d44c608063998a
(5 rows)
```</p>
<p>The resulting hash is a meaningless string of alphanumeric text that functions as a unique identifier for your record. Of course, you could just as easily just create a single concatenated varchar field that performed the same function, but <em>it’s actually important to obfuscate the underlying logic behind the hash</em>: you will innately treat the field differently if it looks like an id versus if it looks like a jumble of human-readable text.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why creating a unique id is an important practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>One of the most common causes of error is duplicate values in a key that an analyst was expecting to be unique. Joins on that field will “fan out” a result set in unexpected ways and can cause significant error that is difficult to troubleshoot. To avoid this, only join on fields where you’ve validated the cardinality and constructed a unique key where necessary.</li>
<li>Some BI tools require you to have a unique key in order to provide certain functionality. For instance, Looker <a href="https://discourse.looker.com/t/symmetric-aggregates/261">symmetric aggregates</a> require a unique key in order to function.</li>
</ol>
<p>We create unique keys for every table and then test uniqueness on this key using <a href="http://dbt.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/testing/">dbt schema tests</a>. We run these tests multiple times per day on <a href="http://sinterdata.com/">Sinter</a> and get notifications for any failures. This allows us to be completely confident of the analytics we implement on top of these data models.</p>
<h2>#2: Simplifying Complex Joins</h2>
<p>This case is similar to #1 in its execution but it solves a very different puzzle. Imagine the following case. You have the same Facebook Ads dataset as referenced earlier but this time you have a new challenge: join that data to data in your web analytics sessions table so that you can calculate Facebook <a href="http://www.verticalrail.com/kb/calculate-roas/">ROAS</a>.</p>
<p>In this case, your available join keys are the date and your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters">UTM parameters</a> (utm_medium, source, campaign, etc). Seems easy, right? Just do a join on all 6 fields and call it a day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that doesn’t work, for a really simple reason: it’s extremely common for some subset of those fields to be null, and a null doesn’t join to another null. So, that 6-field join is a dead end. You can hack together something incredibly complicated using a bunch of conditional logic, but that code is hideous and performs terribly (I’ve tried it).</p>
<p>Instead, use md5(). In both datasets, you can take the 6 fields we mentioned and concatenate them together into a single string, and then call md5() on the entire string. Here’s a code snippet from a client project where we did exactly this:</p>
<p>You can see that this code is actually building the id on top of even more fields: in this example we’re actually unioning together advertising spend data from 7 different ad channels, and the data from Bing and Adwords is identified by ad_group_id and keyword_id instead of by UTM parameters. The approach extends cleanly.</p>
<p>In the sessions table, you then create the exact same hashed id field. <strong>The resulting join is simple, readable, and easy to use for downstream analysis</strong>:</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>Interested in implementing something like this yourself? Here are a few resources:</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! I’m definitely curious to hear if anyone has any additional clever uses for md5().</p>
