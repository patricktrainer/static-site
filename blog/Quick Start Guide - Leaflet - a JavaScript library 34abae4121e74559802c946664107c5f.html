            <h1>Quick Start Guide - Leaflet - a JavaScript library for interactive maps</h1>
<p>Created: Feb 15, 2020 8:22 AM

<p>This step-by-step guide will quickly get you started on Leaflet basics, including setting up a Leaflet map, working with markers, polylines and popups, and dealing with events.</p>

<h3>Preparing your page</h3>
<p>Before writing any code for the map, you need to do the following preparation steps on your page:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Include Leaflet CSS file in the head section of your document:</p>
<p><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.6.0/dist/leaflet.css"
   integrity="sha512-xwE/Az9zrjBIphAcBb3F6JVqxf46+CDLwfLMHloNu6KEQCAWi6HcDUbeOfBIptF7tcCzusKFjFw2yuvEpDL9wQ=="
   crossorigin=""/&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include Leaflet JavaScript file <strong>after</strong> Leaflet’s CSS:</p>
<p><code>&lt;!-- Make sure you put this AFTER Leaflet's CSS --&gt;
 &lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.6.0/dist/leaflet.js"
   integrity="sha512-gZwIG9x3wUXg2hdXF6+rVkLF/0Vi9U8D2Ntg4Ga5I5BZpVkVxlJWbSQtXPSiUTtC0TjtGOmxa1AJPuV0CPthew=="
   crossorigin=""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put a <code>div</code> element with a certain <code>id</code> where you want your map to be:</p>
<p><code>&lt;div id="mapid"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the map container has a defined height, for example by setting it in CSS:</p>
<p>```</p>
<h1>mapid { height: 180px; }</h1>
<p>```</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you’re ready to initialize the map and do some stuff with it.</p>
<h3>Setting up the map</h3>
<p>Let’s create a map of the center of London with pretty Mapbox Streets tiles. First we’ll initialize the map and set its view to our chosen geographical coordinates and a zoom level:</p>
<p><code>var mymap = L.map('mapid').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);</code></p>
<p>By default (as we didn’t pass any options when creating the map instance), all mouse and touch interactions on the map are enabled, and it has zoom and attribution controls.</p>
<p>Note that <code>setView</code> call also returns the map object — most Leaflet methods act like this when they don’t return an explicit value, which allows convenient jQuery-like method chaining.</p>
<p>Next we’ll add a tile layer to add to our map, in this case it’s a Mapbox Streets tile layer. Creating a tile layer usually involves setting the <a href="https://leafletjs.com/reference.html">URL template</a> for the tile images, the attribution text and the maximum zoom level of the layer. In this example we’ll use the <code>mapbox/streets-v11</code> tiles from <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static-tiles">Mapbox’s Static Tiles API</a> (in order to use tiles from Mapbox, you must also <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/">request an access token</a>). Because this API returns 512x512 tiles by default (instead of 256x256), we will also have to explicitly specify this and offset our zoom by a value of -1.</p>
<p><code>L.tileLayer('https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/{id}/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token={accessToken}', {
    attribution: 'Map data &amp;copy; &lt;a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; contributors, &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/"&gt;CC-BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;, Imagery © &lt;a href="https://www.mapbox.com/"&gt;Mapbox&lt;/a&gt;',
    maxZoom: 18,
    id: 'mapbox/streets-v11',
    tileSize: 512,
    zoomOffset: -1,
    accessToken: 'your.mapbox.access.token'
}).addTo(mymap);</code></p>
<p>Make sure all the code is called after the <code>div</code> and <code>leaflet.js</code> inclusion. That’s it! You have a working Leaflet map now.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Leaflet is provider-agnostic, meaning that it doesn’t enforce a particular choice of providers for tiles. You can try replacing <code>mapbox/streets-v11</code> with <code>mapbox/satellite-v9</code>, and see what happens. Also, Leaflet doesn’t even contain a single provider-specific line of code, so you’re free to use other providers if you need to (we’d suggest Mapbox though, it looks beautiful).</p>
<p>Whenever using anything based on OpenStreetMap, an <em>attribution</em> is obligatory as per the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">copyright notice</a>. Most other tile providers (such as <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/attribution/">Mapbox</a>, <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/">Stamen</a> or <a href="https://www.thunderforest.com/terms/">Thunderforest</a>) require an attribution as well. Make sure to give credit where credit is due.</p>
<h3>Markers, circles and polygons</h3>
<p>Besides tile layers, you can easily add other things to your map, including markers, polylines, polygons, circles, and popups. Let’s add a marker:</p>
<p><code>var marker = L.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(mymap);</code></p>
<p>Adding a circle is the same (except for specifying the radius in meters as a second argument), but lets you control how it looks by passing options as the last argument when creating the object:</p>
<p><code>var circle = L.circle([51.508, -0.11], {
    color: 'red',
    fillColor: '#f03',
    fillOpacity: 0.5,
    radius: 500
}).addTo(mymap);</code></p>
<p>Adding a polygon is as easy:</p>
<p><code>var polygon = L.polygon([
    [51.509, -0.08],
    [51.503, -0.06],
    [51.51, -0.047]
]).addTo(mymap);</code></p>
<h3>Working with popups</h3>
<p>Popups are usually used when you want to attach some information to a particular object on a map. Leaflet has a very handy shortcut for this:</p>
<p>Try clicking on our objects. The <code>bindPopup</code> method attaches a popup with the specified HTML content to your marker so the popup appears when you click on the object, and the <code>openPopup</code> method (for markers only) immediately opens the attached popup.</p>
<p>You can also use popups as layers (when you need something more than attaching a popup to an object):</p>
<p>Here we use <code>openOn</code> instead of <code>addTo</code> because it handles automatic closing of a previously opened popup when opening a new one which is good for usability.</p>
<h3>Dealing with events</h3>
<p>Every time something happens in Leaflet, e.g. user clicks on a marker or map zoom changes, the corresponding object sends an event which you can subscribe to with a function. It allows you to react to user interaction:</p>
<p>Each object has its own set of events — see <a href="https://leafletjs.com/reference.html">documentation</a> for details. The first argument of the listener function is an event object — it contains useful information about the event that happened. For example, map click event object (<code>e</code> in the example above) has <code>latlng</code> property which is a location at which the click occurred.</p>
<p>Let’s improve our example by using a popup instead of an alert:</p>
<p>Try clicking on the map and you will see the coordinates in a popup. <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/example.html">View the full example →</a></p>
<p>Now you’ve learned Leaflet basics and can start building map apps straight away! Don’t forget to take a look at the detailed <a href="https://leafletjs.com/reference.html">documentation</a> or <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples.html">other examples</a>.</p>
