<p>Share your favorite things with your favorite people.</p>
<p>Family Sharing makes it easy for up to six family members to share App Store, music, movie, TV, and book purchases, an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT205595">Apple Music Family Subscription</a>, an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210112">Apple Arcade subscription</a>, an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT209513">Apple News+ subscription</a>, an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210627">Apple TV+ subscription</a>, and an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208147">iCloud storage plan</a> — all without sharing each other's Apple accounts. It includes the ability to set up an Apple ID for kids, set permissions remotely with Screen Time, and approve spending and downloads from a parent's device. Your family can also share a photo album, calendar, and reminders, and even <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210515">help locate each others’ missing devices</a>.</p>
<h2>Get organized.</h2>
<p>One adult in your household—the family organizer—chooses a feature for your family to share and invites family members to join. After the family members join, Family Sharing is set up on everyone’s devices automatically. Then if you want to add more services to share with your family, the organizer can update your Family Sharing settings at any time.</p>
<h3>Getting set up is simple.</h3>
<p>You can use Family Sharing on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 8 or later, your Mac with OS X Yosemite or later, or your PC with <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ht204283">iCloud for Windows</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, tap Settings &gt; [your name]. Then tap <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201088">Set Up Family Sharing</a> &gt; Get Started, then follow the onscreen steps.</li>
<li>On your Mac with macOS Catalina or later, choose Apple menu  &gt; System Preferences, then click Family Sharing. Tap Next, then confirm the Apple ID you want to use for Family Sharing. Then follow the onscreen steps. On your Mac with macOS Mojave or earlier, choose Apple menu  &gt; System Preferences, click iCloud, then click <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201088">Set Up Family</a>, then follow the onscreen steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also set up Family Sharing on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch when you sign up for an Apple Music Family Subscription, an Apple Arcade subscription, an Apple News+ subscription, an Apple TV+ subscription, or when you buy an iCloud storage plan to share with your family.</p>
<h2>All your family’s purchases, on all your family’s devices.</h2>
<p>When you <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201085">set up purchase sharing</a>, the songs, albums, movies, TV shows, books, and apps purchased by family members are immediately <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT201088">available to everyone else in the group</a>. And, of course, so are new purchases. The content appears automatically in the Purchased page in the App Store, the iTunes Store, or Apple Books for each family member. Just select the family member whose collection you’d like to browse, then <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT201085">download or play the content you choose</a>. Other family members can access your collection in the same way. If you want to keep some purchases private, you can choose to <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201322">hide individual items</a> or <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201079">choose not to share your purchases</a> in your Family Sharing settings.</p>
<p>In-app purchases can't be shared with your family members. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT203046">Learn more about the types of content you can share</a>.</p>
<h3>Making purchases is easy. So is setting limits.</h3>
<p>With purchase sharing, all new App Store, music, movie, TV, and book purchases made by your family are <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht201079">billed to the organizer’s account</a>. But the organizer can still call the shots. Just turn on <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT201089">Ask to Buy</a> for children in the family. When a child initiates a purchase, an alert is sent to the organizer, who can review the download and approve or decline it right from the organizer’s device. This applies to both purchases and free downloads.</p>
<p><img alt="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/appleid/ios13-iphone-7-tv-app-ask-to-buy.jpg" src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/appleid/ios13-iphone-7-tv-app-ask-to-buy.jpg" /></p>
<p>Before your children can make a purchase, they must ask your permission.</p>
<p><img alt="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/appleid/ios13-iphone-xs-lock-screen-ask-to-buy-request.jpg" src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/appleid/ios13-iphone-xs-lock-screen-ask-to-buy-request.jpg" /></p>
<p>A notification appears on your device. You can review the request, then approve or decline it.</p>
<h2>Share an iCloud storage plan with your family.</h2>
<p>Now you can <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208147">share an iCloud storage plan</a> with your entire family. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201318">Choose a 200GB or 2TB plan</a> to give everyone enough space to store photos, videos, documents, and more. It’s easy to see how much everyone is using, and you can upgrade to a larger plan at any time. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201238">Learn about iCloud storage plans and pricing</a>.</p>
<p>When you share a storage plan, other family members won’t have access to your content unless you choose to share it. And if an adult family member needs more space or wants to use their own iCloud storage, they can choose their own storage plan and still remain part of the family.</p>
<h2>Share subscriptions with everyone in your family.</h2>
<p>With Family Sharing, you can share an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT205595">Apple Music Family Subscription</a>, an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210112">Apple Arcade subscription</a>, an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT209513">Apple News+ subscription</a>, and an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210627">Apple TV+ subscription</a> — all without sharing each other's accounts. The family organizer can invite a family member to share one of these subscriptions through Messages. Just tap "Invite via Messages," enter the family member's name or phone number, and tap Send. The recipient can accept the invite by viewing the invitation and then tapping "Join Family."</p>
<p>You can manage your Family Sharing subscriptions in Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; Family Sharing.</p>
<p>With an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT205595">Apple Music Family Subscription</a>, your family can enjoy unlimited access to Apple Music on their devices. Everyone gets full access to the Apple Music catalog, with millions of songs. And each family member gets their own personal music library, and music recommendations based on what they love to listen to. It’s the whole world of music for the whole family.</p>
<p>When you <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210112">subscribe to Apple Arcade</a>, you get unlimited access to a curated collection of more than 100 new games on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, and Apple TV. With Family Sharing, up to six family members can get access.</p>
<h3>Apple News+</h3>
<p>With an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT209513">Apple News+ subscription</a>, your family can access hundreds of magazines, popular newspapers, and premium digital publishers in the News app on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac. Apple News+ is only available in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
<h3>Apple TV+</h3>
<p>When you <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210627">subscribe to Apple TV+,</a> you'll get original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film, ad-free and on demand. New originals will be added every month, and you can watch Apple TV+ across all of your devices with the Apple TV app.</p>
<h2>Share locations and find devices</h2>
<p>People in your family group can share locations and help other family members find missing devices.</p>
<h3>Keep track of where everybody is.</h3>
<p><img alt="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/appleid/ios13-iphone-xs-find-my-people-family.jpg" src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/appleid/ios13-iphone-xs-find-my-people-family.jpg" /></p>
<p>With <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201088">Family Sharing</a>, you can <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210514">start sharing your location</a> with the rest of the family automatically. If you’re running late to a restaurant or need to know if your kid made it to band practice, just <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210400#enableshare">use the Find My app</a>or <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210514#shareinmessages">the Messages app</a> to keep tabs on each other.</p>
<p>If you need privacy, you can temporarily stop sharing your location by <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210514#turnoffshare">turning off Share My Location in the Find My app</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/appleid/ios13-iphone-xs-find-my-devices-family.jpg" src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/appleid/ios13-iphone-xs-find-my-devices-family.jpg" /></p>
<p>Finding your family’s lost devices is easier when everyone can help. With Family Sharing and Find My [device], any family member can help locate another member’s missing device. Their devices appear in a single list <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210515#markaslost">in the Find My app</a> and on <a href="https://icloud.com/">iCloud.com</a>. So it’s easier than ever to track down a missing or stolen iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac.</p>
<h2>Keep your family on the same page.</h2>
<p>When you set up your family, a <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202786">shared album</a> is created automatically in the Photos app on all family members’ devices. Everyone can add photos, videos, and comments to the album whenever they like and get notified when something new is added.</p>
<p>Family Sharing also sets up a <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202337">family calendar</a> where everyone can view, add, or change events and appointments, and get an alert when something changes. And anyone can <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT205890">use the Reminders app</a> to send time or location reminders to the family. So when it’s picture day, pizza night, or just a trip to the beach, everyone’s in the know.</p>
<p>If you don't want to share the family photo album, calendar, or reminders, you can unsubscribe from them directly on your device, or on <a href="https://www.icloud.com/">iCloud.com</a>.</p>
<h2>See how your family uses their devices.</h2>
<p><img alt="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/iOS/ios13-ipad-pro-iphone-xs-screentime-hero.jpg" src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/iOS/ios13-ipad-pro-iphone-xs-screentime-hero.jpg" /></p>
<p>With Family Sharing, you can share music, movies, apps, and more with family — and it now works with <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208982">Screen Time on iOS</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210387">macOS</a>. You can view reports and adjust settings for children in your family any time, right from your device.</p>
<p>On iOS, if you're already in a family group, go to Settings &gt; Screen Time, and tap your child's name. If you need to create an Apple ID for your child, go to Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; Family Sharing &gt; Screen Time. On macOS, choose Apple menu  &gt; System Preferences, click Family Sharing, and then select Screen Time and tap your child's name. To create an Apple ID for your child, choose Apple menu  &gt; System Preferences, click Family Sharing, and then click Add .</p>
<p>Or if you're <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201088">new to Family Sharing</a>, tap Set up Screen Time for Family and follow the instructions to add a child and set up your family. You can add family members any time from Family Sharing settings.</p>
<p>To use Screen Time with Family Sharing, you need to be the family organizer or parent/guardian in your family group, on iOS 12 or later or macOS Catalina. Your child must be under age 18, in your family group with their own Apple ID, and on iOS 12 or later or macOS Catalina.</p>
<h2>Kids under 13 can have an account, too.</h2>
<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT201084">Kids under 13 can have their own Apple IDs</a>. As a parent or legal guardian, the organizer creates the child’s Apple ID and adds the child to the family group. The organizer can limit the content kids have access to on their devices through <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208982">Screentime on iOS</a> or <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210387">Screentime on macOS</a>. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201089">Ask to Buy</a> is turned on by default for children under 13.</p>
<h2>Learn more.</h2>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204976">Family Sharing requires a personal Apple ID signed in to iCloud</a>. If your family has purchase sharing turned on, apps, music, movies, TV shows, and books can be downloaded on up to 10 devices per account, five of which can be computers.</p>
<p>iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite or later are required to set up or join a Family Sharing group and are recommended for full functionality. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT203046">Not all content is eligible to be shared</a>. Content can be hidden by family members; hidden content is not available for download. Content downloaded from family members or acquired via redemption codes is not subject to Ask to Buy.</p>
