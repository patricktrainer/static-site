<p>Share your favorite things with your favorite people.</p>
<p>Family Sharing makes it easy for up to six family members to share App Store, music, movie, TV, and book purchases, an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT205595" rel="nofollow">Apple Music Family Subscription</a>, an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210112" rel="nofollow">Apple Arcade subscription</a>, an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT209513" rel="nofollow">Apple News+ subscription</a>, an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210627" rel="nofollow">Apple TV+ subscription</a>, and an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208147" rel="nofollow">iCloud storage plan</a> — all without sharing each other's Apple accounts. It includes the ability to set up an Apple ID for kids, set permissions remotely with Screen Time, and approve spending and downloads from a parent's device. Your family can also share a photo album, calendar, and reminders, and even <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210515" rel="nofollow">help locate each others’ missing devices</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-get-organized" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#get-organized"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Get organized.</h2>
<p>One adult in your household—the family organizer—chooses a feature for your family to share and invites family members to join. After the family members join, Family Sharing is set up on everyone’s devices automatically. Then if you want to add more services to share with your family, the organizer can update your Family Sharing settings at any time.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-getting-set-up-is-simple" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#getting-set-up-is-simple"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting set up is simple.</h3>
<p>You can use Family Sharing on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 8 or later, your Mac with OS X Yosemite or later, or your PC with <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ht204283" rel="nofollow">iCloud for Windows</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, tap Settings &gt; [your name]. Then tap <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201088" rel="nofollow">Set Up Family Sharing</a> &gt; Get Started, then follow the onscreen steps.</li>
<li>On your Mac with macOS Catalina or later, choose Apple menu  &gt; System Preferences, then click Family Sharing. Tap Next, then confirm the Apple ID you want to use for Family Sharing. Then follow the onscreen steps. On your Mac with macOS Mojave or earlier, choose Apple menu  &gt; System Preferences, click iCloud, then click <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201088" rel="nofollow">Set Up Family</a>, then follow the onscreen steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also set up Family Sharing on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch when you sign up for an Apple Music Family Subscription, an Apple Arcade subscription, an Apple News+ subscription, an Apple TV+ subscription, or when you buy an iCloud storage plan to share with your family.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-all-your-familys-purchases-on-all-your-familys-devices" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#all-your-familys-purchases-on-all-your-familys-devices"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>All your family’s purchases, on all your family’s devices.</h2>
<p>When you <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201085" rel="nofollow">set up purchase sharing</a>, the songs, albums, movies, TV shows, books, and apps purchased by family members are immediately <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT201088" rel="nofollow">available to everyone else in the group</a>. And, of course, so are new purchases. The content appears automatically in the Purchased page in the App Store, the iTunes Store, or Apple Books for each family member. Just select the family member whose collection you’d like to browse, then <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT201085" rel="nofollow">download or play the content you choose</a>. Other family members can access your collection in the same way. If you want to keep some purchases private, you can choose to <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201322" rel="nofollow">hide individual items</a> or <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201079" rel="nofollow">choose not to share your purchases</a> in your Family Sharing settings.</p>
<p>In-app purchases can't be shared with your family members. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT203046" rel="nofollow">Learn more about the types of content you can share</a>.</p>

<p>With purchase sharing, all new App Store, music, movie, TV, and book purchases made by your family are <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht201079" rel="nofollow">billed to the organizer’s account</a>. But the organizer can still call the shots. Just turn on <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT201089" rel="nofollow">Ask to Buy</a> for children in the family. When a child initiates a purchase, an alert is sent to the organizer, who can review the download and approve or decline it right from the organizer’s device. This applies to both purchases and free downloads.</p>

<p>Now you can <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208147" rel="nofollow">share an iCloud storage plan</a> with your entire family. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201318" rel="nofollow">Choose a 200GB or 2TB plan</a> to give everyone enough space to store photos, videos, documents, and more. It’s easy to see how much everyone is using, and you can upgrade to a larger plan at any time. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201238" rel="nofollow">Learn about iCloud storage plans and pricing</a>.</p>
<p>When you share a storage plan, other family members won’t have access to your content unless you choose to share it. And if an adult family member needs more space or wants to use their own iCloud storage, they can choose their own storage plan and still remain part of the family.</p>

<p>When you <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210112" rel="nofollow">subscribe to Apple Arcade</a>, you get unlimited access to a curated collection of more than 100 new games on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, and Apple TV.

<p>Finding your family’s lost devices is easier when everyone can help. With Family Sharing and Find My [device], any family member can help locate another member’s missing device. Their devices appear in a single list <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210515#markaslost" rel="nofollow">in the Find My app</a> and on <a href="https://icloud.com/" rel="nofollow">iCloud.com</a>. So it’s easier than ever to track down a missing or stolen iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac.</p>

<p>When you set up your family, a <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202786" rel="nofollow">shared album</a> is created automatically in the Photos app on all family members’ devices. Everyone can add photos, videos, and comments to the album whenever they like and get notified when something new is added.</p>
<p>Family Sharing also sets up a <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202337" rel="nofollow">family calendar</a> where everyone can view, add, or change events and appointments, and get an alert when something changes. And anyone can <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT205890" rel="nofollow">use the Reminders app</a> to send time or location reminders to the family. So when it’s picture day, pizza night, or just a trip to the beach, everyone’s in the know.</p>

<p>With Family Sharing, you can share music, movies, apps, and more with family — and it now works with <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208982" rel="nofollow">Screen Time on iOS</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210387" rel="nofollow">macOS</a>. You can view reports and adjust settings for children in your family any time, right from your device.</p>
<p>On iOS, if you're already in a family group, go to Settings &gt; Screen Time, and tap your child's name. If you need to create an Apple ID for your child, go to Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; Family Sharing &gt; Screen Time. On macOS, choose Apple menu  &gt; System Preferences, click Family Sharing, and then select Screen Time and tap your child's name. To create an Apple ID for your child, choose Apple menu  &gt; System Preferences, click Family Sharing, and then click Add .</p>
<p>Or if you're <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201088" rel="nofollow">new to Family Sharing</a>, tap Set up Screen Time for Family and follow the instructions to add a child and set up your family. You can add family members any time from Family Sharing settings.</p>
<p>To use Screen Time with Family Sharing, you need to be the family organizer or parent/guardian in your family group, on iOS 12 or later or macOS Catalina. Your child must be under age 18, in your family group with their own Apple ID, and on iOS 12 or later or macOS Catalina.</p>
