<p>Two methods that have helped me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have an ideas journal. Write new ideas down there, and don't start with any of them in less than two weeks. This lets you get over the initial enthusiasm - and perhaps new better ideas will push less useful ones out of the way in that time. If something stays at the top of your list for weeks, then perhaps it is useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are having trouble deciding between a small number of fixed options, roll the dice. The very fact that you are having trouble deciding means that (within the information available to you right now) all choices are equally good. And sometimes when you see the dice rolling and know that the decision will happen now you realise which one you want.</p>
