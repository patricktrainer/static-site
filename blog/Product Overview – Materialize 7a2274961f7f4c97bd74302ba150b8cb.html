<p>Stream your data. Perform real-time joins. Get instant results.</p>

<h2>What is a Streaming Data Warehouse?</h2>
<p>All of the interactive queryable capabilities of a traditional SQL data warehouse, but connecting directly to your streaming data sources, and staying up-to-date within milliseconds. ‎‎‏‏‎ ‎</p>
<p>No more compromising between flexibility and speed. Materialize delivers SQL exploration for streaming events and real-time data.</p>
<p>No "inspired by SQL" capabilities or half-broken query languages. Materialize is wire compatible with PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>No more ‘eventual consistency’. Materialize emphasizes the correct answer in real-time - without interference from late-arriving data.</p>
<p><img alt="Product%20Overview%20%E2%80%93%20Materialize%207a2274961f7f4c97bd74302ba150b8cb/product-large.png" src="Product%20Overview%20%E2%80%93%20Materialize%207a2274961f7f4c97bd74302ba150b8cb/product-large.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Product%20Overview%20%E2%80%93%20Materialize%207a2274961f7f4c97bd74302ba150b8cb/rest-of-SQL-01-1250.png" src="Product%20Overview%20%E2%80%93%20Materialize%207a2274961f7f4c97bd74302ba150b8cb/rest-of-SQL-01-1250.png" /></p>
<p>Many streaming solutions require the denormalization of data in order to maintain low latency - thereby prohibiting any kind of data enrichment like joins.</p>
<p>By contrast, Materialize offers joins in a SQL interface - including complicated multiple-way (e.g. 6-way, 12-way) joins across disparate data sources.</p>
<h3>...and the rest of SQL, too.</h3>
<p>Materialize provides a single element in the most common programming language. Lower the burden on your data platform team and reuse skills from traditional SQL-based data warehouses.</p>
<p>We support the TPC-H benchmark - a standard built for industry-wide relevance, large data volumes, and high query complexity - with incremental updates.</p>

<h3>Connects directly to event stream processors</h3>
<p>Materialize connects directly to your streaming infrastructure, ingesting streams of data from event stream processors like Kafka. Or connect us directly to your database as a read replica.</p>
<p>Simplify your streaming data architecture. With Materialize, there is no pre-processing of data required to make the system work.</p>
<h3>Combine and analyze real-time and historical data</h3>
<p>Want to run queries against both real-time and historical data? Simply connect Materialize to a storage system like Amazon S3 and union both sources together for a full picture of your data.</p>
<p>The potential for these kinds of enriched streams is massive, and we’re excited to see what our customers can do.</p>

<h3>Presents as Postgres downstream</h3>
<p>Materialize is wire compatible with PostgreSQL, presenting to downstream tools like any Postgres database, simplifying the development of custom applications and streamlining the process of connecting existing data analysis tools.</p>
<p>Even non-technical users can unlock the most complex real-time queries just using standard BI tooling.</p>
<h3>Build views on views on views - or export back to your event stream processor</h3>
<p>Transformations on streaming data can be used to feed into other transformations of that data - say joining several sources, then further querying that information.</p>
<p>Incrementally updating feeds can be directed back into Kafka as a topic for additional applications.</p>

<h2>Use Materialize as an Optimized Read Replica Database</h2>
<p>Traditional read replica databases are optimized for transactional loads – but are usually suboptimal for analytics or visualization. As queries increase, the system can slow down considerably. Using a traditional data warehouse speeds up analytics queries – but on stale data.</p>
<p>Materialize can be used as a highly performant read replica of your relational database – enabling blazing fast analytics queries for data sets both large and small – while staying up-to-date within milliseconds of newly committed transactions.</p>
<p>Materialize can deploy in three ways - as a shared deployment in our multi-tenant cloud, within a customer-specific VPC cloud (managed and owned by Materialize), or within a customer’s public cloud account.</p>
<p>Our system offers high availability via active-active replication. Materialize delivers the output benchmarks of extreme scalability without the performance and expense trade-offs of traditional approaches to scaling.</p>
<h2>Powered by Timely Dataflow</h2>
<p>Materialize offers all of the benefits of Timely Dataflow and Differential Dataflow as a managed cloud service. Both systems have been in open-source development for over 4 years and run in production deployments at global scale.</p>
<p>Timely Dataflow is a low-latency cyclical dataflow computational model that excels at delivering high performance, expressive computation, and consistent results.</p>
