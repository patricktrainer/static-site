<p>Make is a tool which can run commands to read files, process these files in some way, and write out the processed files. For example, in software development, Make is used to compile source code into executable programs or libraries, but Make can also be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>run analysis scripts on raw data files to get data files that summarize the raw data;</li>
<li>run visualization scripts on data files to produce plots; and to</li>
<li>parse and combine text files and plots to create papers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make is called a build tool - it builds data files, plots, papers, programs or libraries. It can also update existing files if desired.</p>
<p>Make tracks the dependencies between the files it creates and the files used to create these. If one of the original files (e.g. a data file) is changed, then Make knows to recreate, or update, the files that depend upon this file (e.g. a plot).</p>
<p>There are now many build tools available, all of which are based on the same concepts as Make.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prerequisites In this lesson we use make from the Unix Shell. Some previous experience with using the shell to list directories, create, copy, remove and list files and directories, and run simple scripts is necessary.</p>
<p>Setup In order to follow this lesson, you will need to download some files. Please follow instructions on the setup page.</p>
