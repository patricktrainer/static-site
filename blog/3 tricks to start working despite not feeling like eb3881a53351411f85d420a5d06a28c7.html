<p>Ever wish you felt like creating that presentation? Felt like doing that research? Felt like doing the dishes?</p>
<p>Most of us do.</p>
<p>It's easy to start when we feel like it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we often don't.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="3%20tricks%20to%20start%20working%20despite%20not%20feeling%20like%20eb3881a53351411f85d420a5d06a28c7/feel_like_it.png"><img src="3%20tricks%20to%20start%20working%20despite%20not%20feeling%20like%20eb3881a53351411f85d420a5d06a28c7/feel_like_it.png" alt="3%20tricks%20to%20start%20working%20despite%20not%20feeling%20like%20eb3881a53351411f85d420a5d06a28c7/feel_like_it.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></p>
<p>We don't feel ready. We don't feel like the work is going to be good enough. We don't feel like we have the motivation.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: <strong>we don't have to feel like it to start.</strong></p>
<p>We can start writing, even if we think the words are rubbish.</p>
<p>We can start creating, sketching, planning,... even though we're uncertain of the results of our efforts.</p>
<p>Every time we consciously go "Okay, let's do this" instead of checking Twitter for the tenth time this hour, we're training this ability.</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-screw-it-lets-do-it" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#screw-it-lets-do-it"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>"Screw it, let's do it"</h3>
<p>Billionaire Richard Branson has a catchphrase: "Screw it, let's do it"</p>
<p>He even wrote a book by that title. The lesson of it is simple: despite all the doubt, all the fear, all the negativity, let's take the leap.</p>
<p>Publish that post. Message that person. Start that company.</p>
<p>It's a simple mantra that can inspire you to <em>approach</em>, instead of <em>avoid</em>.</p>
<p><strong>When you get tired of thinking about a piece of work and feeling bad for not finishing it yet, go "screw it, let's do it" and start with something, anything.</strong></p>
<h3><a id="user-content-start-sloppy" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#start-sloppy"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Start sloppy</h3>
<p>Another trick to start sloppy - you might have high expectations of your finished work.</p>
<p>You want to write a great book, not just a good one. Or create a stellar artwork, or start a great business.</p>
<p>All those expectations can put more pressure on you than you can bear, leading you to avoid it by procrastinating.</p>
<p>Instead, you can escape those expectations by <em>starting deliberately badly.</em></p>
<p>Write a chapter of a book by hand - you know that's not what will get published.
Start designing a poster with a sharpie, instead of the latest high-tech illustrating program.
Create a working prototype for your first product that you'd never ship to anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>When you know that you don't have to make the greatest thing ever right from the start, it's easier to start. And then it's easier to continue.</strong></p>
<h3><a id="user-content-start-small" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#start-small"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Start small</h3>
<p>You probably don't feel like creating a 20 slide presentation right now from scratch and presenting it in 2 hours.</p>
<p>You don't feel like writing a whole final thesis on a topic you barely know.</p>
<p>You don't feel like running a marathon.</p>
<p>But you might feel like looking up a couple pictures or articles for the presentation.</p>
<p>Or feel like writing a paragraph or two before lunch break.</p>
<p>Or feel like taking a 5km walk.</p>
<p>All those are small steps along a possible longer journey. And taking those steps, while they may seem tiny, is what can lead to ultimately completing the longer journey.</p>
<p><strong>Every small win is motivating. Every small win builds momentum. Momentum energizes.</strong></p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<p><strong>Is it time to go "screw it, let's do it"?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Could a deliberately sloppy start help you move forward?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Or what's the smallest step you can take right now?</strong></p>
