<p>Indeed. Some of these models are partially-applied functions - they're missing the part that actually makes them money. For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Network effects (can come in different forms such as direct, two-sided, data): Facebook — the value of the product increases as more people use it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Network effects keeps the users in, money is made by ads and surveillance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crowdsourcing: YouTube — aggregate content/product from users individuals and distributes them at scale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really, it's also a form of network effects (viewers go where most content is; creators go where most viewers are), and again, money is made by ads and surveillance.</p>
<p>Also, missing models:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regulatory arbitrage: Uber - conquering markets by breaking local laws faster than the regulators can react.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploiting social capital: AirBnB - facilitating illegal or highly undesirable behavior at scale, not caring about the neighbors of service's users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open-source: Bitcoin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin is not a company and does not have a business model. Also, "Open Source" is not a business model. "Donations" and "Paid support" are.</p>
