<p>Created: Mar 21, 2020 10:12 PM
URL: <a href="https://guide.bash.academy/" rel="nofollow">https://guide.bash.academy/</a></p>
<p>This guide is an introduction to basic and advanced concepts of the bash shell.</p>
<p>It teaches both newcomers and long-time users the best, safest and most robust ways of writing powerful bash scripts as well as making efficient and speedy interactive use of the shell.</p>
<p>This guide has gone through several iterations and is the result of a severe lack of consistent, clear and reliable language on the topic on the rest of the Internet as well as the public library or book stores.</p>
