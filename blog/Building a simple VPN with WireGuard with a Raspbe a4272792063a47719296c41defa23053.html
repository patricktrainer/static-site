<p>Now that wireguard will be part of the upcoming Linux 5.6 Kernel it’s time to see how to best integrate it with my <a href="https://snikt.net/blog/2019/06/22/building-an-lte-access-point-with-a-raspberry-pi/" rel="nofollow">Raspberry Pi based LTE-Router/Access Point Setup</a>.</p>
<h1><a id="user-content-what-is-my-scenario" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-my-scenario"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is my scenario?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi 3 with a LTE hat, using a public IP address. This will be the VPN server (called <em>edgewalker</em> in this post)</li>
<li>An Android Phone that should use the VPN for all communication when connected</li>
<li>An Linux Laptop that should use the VPN only accessing network services that are exposed to the VPN</li>
</ul>
<p>Each device connected to the VPN should be able to connect to all other devices, e.g., my phone should be able to connect to a webserver running on the laptop as long as both are part of the VPN network. If setup is easy enough I’m actually thinking about adding my (Ethernet-connected) Desktop to the VPN too.</p>
<p>Given that wired and wireless connections seem to become more insecure over time (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations" rel="nofollow">Tailored Access Operations</a>, <a href="https://www.krackattacks.com/" rel="nofollow">KRACK attacks against WPA2</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/04/serious-flaws-leave-wpa3-vulnerable-to-hacks-that-steal-wi-fi-passwords/" rel="nofollow">Dragonblood attacks against WPA3</a>) I am seriously considering using wireguard for all my devices, regardless in which environment they are running.</p>
<h1><a id="user-content-installing-the-software" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#installing-the-software"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing the Software</h1>
<p>WireGuard provides <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/" rel="nofollow">pre-compiled software packages</a> for most Linux Distributions, Windows and MacOS. Android and iOS applications are provided through the different app stores.</p>
<p>I am using the current Fedora Linux 31 and failed reading the fine manual. I searched for <code>wireguard-tools</code> packages, found and installed them. And then was wondering why nothing was working. Further investigation showed that I did not have the <code>wireguard-dkms</code> package installed (containing the network driver) and this package was not contained within my distribution repository.</p>
<p>Would I have read the manual I would have done the right steps:</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%20d60fe88e71e44732b941d302ac9e9c3f.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>On the Raspberry Pi I am using Raspbian Buster, this distribution already included the <code>wireguard</code> package, I installed it with:</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%2084d4eda03d13471b80045aaef74664fc.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>On the Android Phone, I used the Google App Store to install the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android" rel="nofollow">WireGuard VPN Application</a>.</p>
<h1><a id="user-content-key-setup" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-setup"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Key Setup</h1>
<p>Wireguard utilizes a simple private/public key scheme to authenticate VPN peers. You can easily create VPN keys with the following command:</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%201cead0efbd0b4811bd8070bae3d68f7f.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>This gives us three keypairs (and thus six files at all). We will not refer to those files within the configuration files but copy their content (which is just a single line which is the base64-encoded key) in the configuration files.</p>
<h1><a id="user-content-creating-a-configuration-file-for-the-vpn-server-raspberry-pi" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#creating-a-configuration-file-for-the-vpn-server-raspberry-pi"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating a configuration file for the VPN Server (Raspberry Pi)</h1>
<p>Configuration was quite easy, I just created the following file at <code>/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</code>:</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%2086ffbe2372fc4cddb21de52e39da3613.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please fill in the values from the created key files</li>
<li>I am creating a VPN network that uses <code>10.200.200.0/24</code> for its internal IP range</li>
<li>my server uses <code>wwan0</code> as external network interface in the <code>PostUp</code>/<code>PostDown</code>-Commands, please adapt that to use your network-facing interface (might be eth0)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s easy to bring the VPN network up with the following command:</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%209e7f760a758b4f3da348009db1e264ad.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>One small thing: I am using <code>dnsmasq</code> as DNS server and have bound it to the network interface <code>br0</code>. This will be too restrictive for serving DNS requests from connected VPN devices so I added the <code>wg0</code> wireguard Ethernet devices to the allowed device list. In dnsmasq you do this by adding a new config line to <code>/etc/dnsmasq.conf</code> with the network interface, e.g.:</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%20f5595dbeabe74a6e971485162a5c2e4f.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>In addition I’ve added some iptable rules to allow traffic to the listening UDP port (51280):</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%204579712d7bb14b59a88ae36b27fc8775.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>Now that everything works, we can utilize systemd to automatically start the VPN tunnel:</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%200b7dbc84ab72443791bc5a0a11274e33.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>Mostly the Laptop setup consists of creating a matching configuration file in <code>/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</code> on the Laptop:</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%207e45ff8493b34fa1ade1a84ee8e6af77.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>edgewalker should be the public IP-address or public hostname of the VPN server</li>
<li>By setting <code>AllowedIPs</code> to <code>10.200.200.0/24</code> we are only using the VPN for accessing the internal VPN network. Traffic to all other IPs/servers will still use the “normal” public internet. Also the pre-configured DNS-Server on the Laptop will be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use the same <code>wg-quick</code> and <code>systemd</code> commands for testing as well as for automatic connection setup:</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%207b80b1d9c6324faf8e42408ed27aae3b.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>We use a very similar configuration file for our Android phone. We prepare the following file (let’s call it <code>mobile.conf</code>) on the server through ssh:</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%2037e075f9123d4f9088f16fb3a8531955.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>In contrast to the laptop setup we are forcing the mobile device to use our VPN server as DNS server (that’s the <code>DNS</code> setting) as well as using the newly VPN tunnel for all traffic (by using <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> as wildcard for <code>AllowedIPs</code>).</p>
<p>It would be tedious to copy this configuration file onto a mobile device, so we convert it into a QR code:</p>
<p><a href="Building%20a%20simple%20VPN%20with%20WireGuard%20with%20a%20Raspbe%20a4272792063a47719296c41defa23053/Untitled%20Database%2039463337e91740079981ae4a2aef5d08.csv">Untitled</a></p>
<p>This outputs an ASCII QR-Code on the console. This code can be scanned from within the Android VPN application and automatically setups the VPN tunnel.</p>

<p>WireGuard’s configuration is just magic when compared to similar OpenVPN setups..</p>
