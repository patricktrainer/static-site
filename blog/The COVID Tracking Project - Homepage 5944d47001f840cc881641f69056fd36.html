<p>The COVID Tracking Project collects information from 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and 5 other US territories to provide the most comprehensive testing data we can collect for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. We attempt to include <strong>positive and negative results</strong>, <strong>pending tests</strong>, and <strong>total people tested for</strong> each state or district currently reporting that data.</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-what-and-why" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-and-why"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What and Why</h2>
<p>Testing is a crucial part of any public health response, and sharing test data is essential to understanding this outbreak. The CDC is currently not publishing complete testing data, so we’re doing our best to collect it from each state and provide it to the public. The information is patchy and inconsistent, so we’re being transparent about what we find and how we handle it—the spreadsheet includes our live comments about changing data and how we’re working with incomplete information.</p>
<p>From here, you can also <a href="https://covidtracking.com/about-tracker/" rel="nofollow">learn about our methodology</a>, <a href="https://covidtracking.com/about-team/" rel="nofollow">see who makes this</a>, and <a href="https://covidtracking.com/notes/" rel="nofollow">find out what information states provide and how we handle it</a>.</p>
