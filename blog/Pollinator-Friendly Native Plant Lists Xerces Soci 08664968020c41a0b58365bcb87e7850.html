<p>We've prepared the following lists of recommended native plants that are highly attractive to pollinators such as native bees, honey bees, butterflies, moths, and hummingbirds, and are well-suited for small-scale plantings in gardens, on business and school campuses, in urban greenspaces, and in farm field borders.</p>
<p>These lists are not intended to be exhaustive, but reflect a "best-of" approach identifying plants known from various trials and research efforts to provide a number of benefits to a diversity of pollinators, are regionally appropriate, and highly adaptable to a range of growing conditions.</p>
<p>For more plant suggestions, see all <a href="https://xerces.org/publications?field_publication_type_target_id=38&amp;field_state_target_id=All&amp;field_keywords_target_id=All&amp;field_program_target_id=All">Plant Lists in our Publications Library</a>, or check out our books <em><a href="https://xerces.org/books/100-plants-feed-bees">100 Plants to Feed the Bees</a></em> and <em><a href="https://xerces.org/books/gardening-butterflies">Gardening for Butterflies</a></em>.
