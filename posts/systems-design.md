## Stages
Design and development of a system can be divided into four stages, each with different definitions
* task definition (informative definition),
* conceptual stage (cardinal definition),
* design stage (formative definition), and
* implementation stage (manufacturing definition).
Depending on their application, tools are used for various stages of the systems engineering process:

## Dynamic systems
When building a model of a dynamic system:
* Define the system and its components.
* Formulate the mathematical model and list the needed assumptions.
* Write the differential equations describing the model.
* Solve the equations for the desired output variables.
* Examine the solutions and the assumptions.
* If needed, reanalyze or redesign the system.
